# 📊 Profit Prediction with 50 Startups Dataset

This machine learning project focuses on predicting startup profits based on investment in R&D, Administration, and Marketing. It compares five regression models and visualizes the predictions using bar charts for performance analysis.

---

## 🧠 Objective

To apply multiple regression techniques and compare their performance in predicting startup profits using the R² score.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- `50_Startups.csv`
- Features: `R&D Spend`, `Administration`, `Marketing Spend`
- Target: `Profit`

---

## 🧪 Models Used

| Model                       | R² Score |
|----------------------------|----------|
| Multiple Linear Regression | 0.9394   |
| Polynomial Regression      | 0.9202   |
| Decision Tree Regression   | 0.9764   |
| Random Forest Regression   | 0.9603   |
| Support Vector Regression  | 0.8246   |

---

## 📊 Visualization

Each model was evaluated by visualizing the predicted and actual profits for 10 test cases using **matplotlib bar charts**.

- **Blue bars**: Actual Profit
- **Red bars**: Predicted Profit
